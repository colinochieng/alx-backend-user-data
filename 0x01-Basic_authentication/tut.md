# Basic authentication
## Background Context
In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement a **Basic Authentication** on a simple API.  
In the industry, you should __not__ implement your own Basic authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.
